=== Planetary Dictator ===

### Description

An electron based filemanger in the style of Norton Commander or Filezilla for managing the filestore of an IPFS ( Interplanetary Filesystem ) node.

### Getting started

* _npm install_ To get the required dependencies
* In a terminal run the _gulp_ task so any changes to the SASS stylesheet is reflected in the app.
* _npm start_ to start an instance of Planetary Dictator

### Immediate Roadmap

A lot of work is required, this software is currently sub Alpha. Some of the more immediate tasks are:

* Pinning of files to the IPFS node
* Making the interface somewhat presentable
* Sorting out how to present objects from directories in the IPFS view
